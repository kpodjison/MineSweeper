# MineSweeper
Succesfully unvail all mines without clicking on a bomb.

Minesweeper is a game about learning patterns using the process of elimination.
For each block, itâ€™s surrounded by a complete square of eight other blocks. 
These surrounding blocks are referred to as neighbors of the blocks. 
The game field is made up of randomly placed bombs cells marked number cells and empty cells. 
The player must find a way to uncover all numbers and empty cells without clicking a cell that contains a bomb/mine.
A player is at liberty to flag a cell at any time in the game play and also un-flagged, 
but that has no impact of on whether or not an allocated bomb can be changed. 
Bombs are randomly placed when the game is set and cannot have their positions changed during gameplay.
